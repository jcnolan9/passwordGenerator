# passwordGenerator

## Description
In this assignment I was given some starting HTML, CSS, and minor amount of javascript code for a password generator web app. I implemented all the necessary code to grab input from 
the user for how long they wanted their password to be, if they wanted to include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Based on this information
I implemented the logic to produce a random password and show it in the text area. The logic included understanding how to randomly select from the pool of numbers, letters, and other characters
for each character in the pasword.
